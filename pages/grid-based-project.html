SAY IF NOT A MOON
Karen An-Hwei Lee
Gliding in circles, a moon slides in from the sea
and will exit again at high tide.
No larger than a fin, the moon scales our eucalyptus grove.
The moon sleeps in a house where shadows are no longer in love.
Moon on a woman’s handmirrors the carbon symmetries
of the charcoal she holds – sketching.
Night is the new moonshorn for a letter
mailed overseas.I hear no farewell nor see nostalgia
in a lunar cloud.
The low tide where a moon circles
finned without gills
swallows a star whose own name nobody knows. Eye without an iris
observes a faded worldwithout judgment
waiting on God.
What I did not hear this evening or failed to see:
Not-a-moon humming
this pupil of light.

THE LIGHT BY THE BARN
William Stafford
The light by the barn that shines all night
pales at dawn when a little breeze comes.
A little breeze comes breathing the fields
from their sleep and waking the slow windmill.
The slow windmill sings the long day
about anguish and loss to the chickens at work.
The little breeze follows the slow windmill
and the chickens at work till the sun goes down—
Then the light by the barn again.

WHAT CAN BE GRASPED?
Lewis Meyers
Out at the tricky intersection, oil trucks
Stop dead on dimes, I listen in;
That squealing halt, whose pulse-beat doesn’t catch
As if, at the ringside of a fight,
One’s head and shoulders rode with every punch?
Kafka’s nerves would snap.
